Start state: q0
Final state: q2
Transition function:
q0, a => q1
q1, a => q1
q1, b => q2
To check if the string "abaab" is accepted by the NFA, you can follow the transitions in the automaton:

Start at q0, read 'a' and go to q1
Read 'b' and go to q2
Read 'a' and go back to q1
Read 'a' and go to q1
Read 'b' and go to q2
Since the automaton reaches the final state q2 after reading the last character 'b', the string "abaab" is accepted by the NFA.
