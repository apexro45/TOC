Define the input alphabet, tape alphabet, and the set of states. In this case, the input alphabet would be {'b'}. The tape alphabet would include 'b', 'a', and a blank symbol 'B'. The set of states would include the initial state, the accepting state, and a set of intermediate states.

Define the transition function that specifies the actions that the Turing Machine will take based on the current state and the symbol read from the tape. The transition function should specify the next state, the symbol to be written on the tape, and the direction to move the head.

Initialize the Turing Machine with the input string "bbabb" on the tape and set the current state to the initial state.

Implement the simulation by executing the transition function in a loop until either the Turing Machine reaches the accepting state or it enters a non-accepting state.

Finally, check if the Turing Machine is in the accepting state after the simulation. If it is, then the input string is accepted as a palindrome, otherwise, it is not accepted
